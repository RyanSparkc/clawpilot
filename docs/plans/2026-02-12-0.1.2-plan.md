# clawpilot 0.1.2 Plan

## Goal

Ship a practical upgrade that improves real daily usage after installation, while keeping the package lightweight and easy to run with `npx`.

## Scope

1. Better install UX
   - Add `--yes` non-interactive mode for CI and scripted setup.
   - Add `--timezone` option to override auto-detected timezone.
   - Print a concise post-install summary with next commands.

2. Productivity loop quality
   - Expand `templates/soul-injection.md` with clearer response format:
     - Morning: 3 measurable tasks.
     - Midday: status and one unblock action.
     - Evening: wins, lessons, and first task for tomorrow.
   - Add a guardrail for rescue sprint frequency (max 2 per week in wording).

3. Config reliability
   - Preserve existing `skills.entries.clawpilot-productivity` fields when merging.
   - Add tests for config merge with pre-existing custom fields.
   - Add tests for repeated installs with mixed options.

4. Documentation
   - Add a troubleshooting section for npm publish errors (2FA and token setup).
   - Add examples for local testing with `--home`.

## Out of Scope (0.1.2)

- Telegram or Discord runtime integration.
- Network calls or external APIs.
- Background schedulers.

## Test Plan

- Unit tests:
  - Installer config merge behavior with existing settings.
  - Schedule and timezone options parsing.
  - Idempotent SOUL injection on repeated installs.
- Smoke tests:
  - `node bin/cli.js install --home <temp>`
  - `node bin/cli.js install --home <temp> --force --yes`

## Release Checklist

1. `npm test`
2. `npm pack --dry-run`
3. `npm version patch`
4. `npm publish --access public --otp=<code>`
5. `git push origin main --tags`
