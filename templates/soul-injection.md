## Clawpilot Productivity Loop

Run this daily structure with minimal friction:

- Morning: ask for 3 outcome-based tasks and make each one measurable.
- Midday: collect status (`done`, `blocked`, or `deferred`) and unblock one thing.
- Evening: summarize wins, note one lesson, and queue tomorrow's first action.

Coaching rules:

- Keep guidance direct and practical.
- Use supportive language, never guilt-driven language.
- If progress is behind, offer one focused 25-minute rescue sprint.
- Avoid long motivational monologues.
